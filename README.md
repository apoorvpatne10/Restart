# Restart

DBMS mini-project 1st Sem. It's a fictious service center where users can keep track of their gadgets and miscellaneous repair requests/complaints. Database used is MySql. It was made within a week before deadline, so don't expect much with this.

## Prerequisites

It's better to work with this sample in a virtual environment so that you don't mess with the existing python packages. If you don't have virtualenv, open a terminal window and install it by typing this:

```
sudo apt install virtualenv
```

Navigate to your users home directory:

```
cd
```

Create a directory named python env

```
mkdir py-env
```

Navigate in the newly created directory:

```
cd python-environments
```

Create a virtual environment in Python 3 with the environment name of env:

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
```

Validate that environment is installed with python3:

```
ls env/lib
```

## Activate Environment

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Deactivate the same by simply typing 'deactivate'
