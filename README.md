DBMS mini-project 1st Sem. It's a fictious service center where users can keep track of their gadgets and miscellaneous repair requests/complaints. Database used is MySql. It was made within a week before deadline, so don't expect much with this.

## Prerequisites

It's better to work with this sample in a virtual environment so that you don't mess with the existing python packages. If you don't have virtualenv, open a terminal window and install it by typing this:

```
sudo apt install virtualenv
```

Navigate to your users home directory:

```
cd
```

Create a directory named python env

```
mkdir py-env
```

Navigate in the newly created directory:
```
cd python-environments
```
